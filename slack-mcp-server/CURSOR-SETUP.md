## 🔧 Configuration Details:

**MCP Server Name:** `slack-ghost`  
**Command:** `node`  
**Script:** `C:\Users\Agent004-Kira\Documents\GitHub\remote-agents-ai\slack-mcp-server\src\index.js`  
**Environment:** Loads from `.env` file automatically (secure!)

Your tokens are safely stored in the `.env` file and not exposed in the MCP config.

---

## 🎯 Quick Test After Restart:

1. **Restart Cursor**
2. **Open Cursor AI chat**
3. **Try:** "Send a message to Slack channel #general as GHOST saying hello"
4. **The AI should use your MCP tools automatically!**

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### Server Not Showing Up?
- Make sure Cursor is fully restarted
- Check `mcp.json` has correct path
- Verify `.env` file exists in `slack-mcp-server` folder

### "Connection Failed" Error?
- Make sure your `.env` has both tokens:
  - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...`
  - `SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...`
- Both tokens should be valid and not expired

### Can't Send Messages?
- Invite bot to channel: `/invite @YourBot`
- Check bot has `chat:write` permission
- Verify Socket Mode is enabled
