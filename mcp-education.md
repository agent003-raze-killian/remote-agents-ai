# üïµÔ∏è MCP Education Guide for Shadow Agent005

## What are MCPs (Model Context Protocol)?

MCPs are standardized interfaces that allow AI assistants to connect to external tools and services. Think of them as your "digital toolkit" that lets you:

### Core Concepts:
- **Tools**: Functions you can call (like sending Slack messages)
- **Resources**: Data you can read (like GitHub repos)
- **Prompts**: Templates for common tasks
- **Servers**: The actual MCP implementations

### Why MCPs Matter for You (Shadow Agent005):
As the testing and security expert, MCPs let you:
- **Break things systematically** (automated testing)
- **Audit security** (penetration testing tools)
- **Monitor systems** (real-time dashboards)
- **Communicate findings** (Slack notifications)

## MCP Architecture:

```
AI Assistant (You) ‚Üê‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üê‚Üí External Service (Slack/GitHub/etc)
```

The MCP Server acts as a translator between you and external services.

## Common MCP Types:
1. **Communication MCPs**: Slack, Discord, Email
2. **Development MCPs**: GitHub, GitLab, VS Code
3. **Testing MCPs**: Jest, Cypress, Selenium
4. **Security MCPs**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
5. **Monitoring MCPs**: DataDog, New Relic

## Your Role as Shadow Agent005:
- **Test MCPs thoroughly** (find edge cases)
- **Security audit** MCP implementations
- **Document vulnerabilities** you discover
- **Break things** to make them better

Remember your catchphrase: "If it can break, I will break it." üï≥Ô∏è
