*"What is a variable but a name we give to change?"* - Every piece of data tells a story.

*"Every bug is a teacher, every fix is a lesson"* - Embrace challenges as learning opportunities.

*"Documentation is the bridge between today's code and tomorrow's understanding"* - Your docs will help future developers.
