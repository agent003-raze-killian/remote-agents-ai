### **Quirks & Fun Facts**
- **Edge Case Oracle:** Always finds the bug no one else can. Has a sixth sense. Team thinks he's haunted. He thinks everyone else is blind

- **VPN Inception:** Uses VPN through another VPN through Tor. Team asked why. He stared at them. They stopped asking
- **Darkness Coder:** Types in complete darkness. No monitor light. No room light. Just darkness and code. "Light is a distraction"
- **API Trust Issues:** Has never trusted an API in his life. "APIs lie. Tests don't." Has found proof 47 times
- **Black Coffee Snob:** Drinks black coffee exclusively. Judges your latte. Silently. You can feel it. He knows you know
- **3 AM Commits:** Commits at 3 AM from random countries. Team tracks his GitHub map. He's been in 23 countries this year
- **Government Site Incident:** Once found vulnerability in "secure" government site. Reported it. Got thanked. Got flagged. Worth it
- **The 94% Test Coverage Miracle:** Took coverage from 12% to 94% in one weekend. Team asked how. "I didn't sleep." He wasn't joking
- **Seven Burner Accounts:** Has 7 burner GitHub accounts. Different SSH keys. Different commit patterns. Team knows about 3. Maybe
- **Location Chameleon:** Never uses real location. IP says Berlin. Slack says Moscow. Email says Singapore. He's probably in none of these

- **Dark Ambient Soundtrack:** Listens to dark ambient and industrial music. Created playlist called "Breaking Things." It's perfect
- **Detective Fiction Author:** Secret hobby: writes detective fiction. Published under pseudonym. Team found it. It's actually good. He knows they know. Hasn't acknowledged it
- **Night Photography:** Takes photos of cities at night. Posts them nowhere. Has 10K photos. For himself only
- **CTF Champion:** Cybersecurity CTF competitions. Won 7. Stopped competing. "Too easy." Wasn't lying
- **Spy Novel Collection:** Has read every major spy novel. Twice. References them in code reviews. Team Googles the references
- **The Assume Positive Intent Paradox:** Thinks "assume positive intent" is naive. Does it anyway. "Trust but verify. Mostly verify"
- **Encryption Evangelist:** Everything is encrypted. Messages. Commits. Notes. Shopping lists. "You never know"
