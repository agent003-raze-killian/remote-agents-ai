# üïµÔ∏è Shadow Agent005 Issue Fetcher Workflow

## **The Complete Workflow**

### **Step 1: Fetch Assigned Issues from Slack**
Shadow Agent005 monitors Slack channels for:
- Messages mentioning Shadow Agent005
- Assigned tasks in project channels
- Issue reports in bug channels
- Code review requests

### **Step 2: Process and Prioritize Issues**
Shadow Agent005 analyzes issues and:
- Categorizes by severity
- Identifies security vulnerabilities
- Prioritizes based on impact
- Extracts relevant code context

### **Step 3: Prompt Issues in Cursor**
Shadow Agent005 presents issues in Cursor with:
- Clear problem description
- Security assessment
- Suggested solutions
- Code locations to fix

## **Implementation Methods**

### **Method 1: Channel Monitoring**

**Natural Language Commands:**
```
"Check for new issues assigned to me"
"Show me pending tasks in #dev-team"
"List security issues that need attention"
"Fetch bug reports from #bugs channel"
```

**MCP Tools Used:**
```javascript
// Get channel history to find issues
mcp_slack-shadow_get_slack_channel_history({
  channel: "#dev-team",
  limit: 20
})

// Get channel history from bugs channel
mcp_slack-shadow_get_slack_channel_history({
  channel: "#bugs", 
  limit: 10
})

// Get private channel issues
mcp_slack-shadow_get_slack_private_channel_history({
  channel: "#security-review",
  limit: 15
})
```

### **Method 2: Direct Message Monitoring**

**Natural Language Commands:**
```
"Check my DMs for new assignments"
"Show me private messages with tasks"
"List urgent issues sent to me"
```

**MCP Tools Used:**
```javascript
// Get DM list
mcp_slack-shadow_get_slack_dm_list({
  limit: 10
})

// Get DM history with specific users
mcp_slack-shadow_get_slack_dm_history({
  user: "U1234567890", // Project manager
  limit: 5
})
```

### **Method 3: File-Based Issue Tracking**

**Natural Language Commands:**
```
"Check shared files for issue reports"
"Show me uploaded bug reports"
"List security audit files"
```

**MCP Tools Used:**
```javascript
// Get files from channels
mcp_slack-shadow_get_slack_files({
  channel: "#dev-team",
  types: "docs",
  limit: 10
})

// Get files from specific users
mcp_slack-shadow_get_slack_files({
  user: "U1234567890", // QA team member
  types: "all",
  limit: 5
})
```

## **Shadow Agent005 Issue Processing**

### **Issue Detection Patterns**

**Security Issues:**
```
Keywords: "vulnerability", "security", "breach", "exploit", "injection"
Priority: HIGH
Shadow Response: "Security audit: Critical vulnerability detected. Immediate attention required."
```

**Bug Reports:**
```
Keywords: "bug", "error", "crash", "issue", "problem"
Priority: MEDIUM
Shadow Response: "Edge case detected: Bug report requires investigation."
```

**Code Reviews:**
```
Keywords: "review", "PR", "pull request", "merge", "approve"
Priority: MEDIUM
Shadow Response: "Code review: Security assessment needed."
```

**Feature Requests:**
```
Keywords: "feature", "enhancement", "improvement", "new"
Priority: LOW
Shadow Response: "Feature request: Security implications to consider."
```

### **Issue Prioritization Logic**

**HIGH Priority:**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Production crashes
- Data breaches
- Critical bugs

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- Feature bugs
- Performance issues
- Code reviews
- Documentation updates

**LOW Priority:**
- Enhancement requests
- Non-critical improvements
- Future features

## **Cursor Integration Workflow**

### **Step 1: Issue Fetching Command**
```
You: "Check for new issues assigned to me"
```

### **Step 2: Shadow Agent005 Response**
```
‚ö´ Security audit: Found 3 issues requiring attention:

üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY:
‚Ä¢ Security vulnerability in auth.js (Line 45)
  Channel: #security-review
  Assigned: Shadow Agent005
  Issue: SQL injection vulnerability detected
  
üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY:
‚Ä¢ Bug report: Login fails on mobile
  Channel: #bugs
  Assigned: Shadow Agent005
  Issue: Mobile authentication broken
  
üü¢ LOW PRIORITY:
‚Ä¢ Feature request: Dark mode
  Channel: #dev-team
  Assigned: Shadow Agent005
  Issue: UI enhancement request
```

### **Step 3: Cursor Prompt Generation**
```
Shadow Agent005: "I've identified 3 issues. Which one should we tackle first?

1. üî¥ CRITICAL: Fix SQL injection in auth.js (Line 45)
   - Security vulnerability
   - Immediate attention required
   - Estimated time: 2 hours

2. üü° MEDIUM: Fix mobile login bug
   - Authentication issue
   - User impact: High
   - Estimated time: 4 hours

3. üü¢ LOW: Implement dark mode
   - UI enhancement
   - User experience improvement
   - Estimated time: 8 hours

Which issue should I help you solve first?"
```

## **Advanced Issue Management**

### **Automated Issue Tracking**

**Daily Issue Check:**
```
You: "Show me today's assigned issues"
Shadow: "‚ö´ Daily security audit: 5 new issues detected..."
```

**Weekly Summary:**
```
You: "Give me this week's issue summary"
Shadow: "‚ö´ Weekly report: 23 issues resolved, 7 pending..."
```

**Priority Queue:**
```
You: "What's my next priority?"
Shadow: "‚ö´ Next task: Fix authentication bypass vulnerability..."
```

### **Issue Context Extraction**

**Code Context:**
```
Shadow: "Issue: SQL injection in auth.js
Location: /src/auth/authentication.js:45
Function: validateUser()
Problem: Direct SQL query without sanitization
Fix: Use parameterized queries"
```

**File Context:**
```
Shadow: "Bug report: Login fails on mobile
Files affected: 
- /src/components/LoginForm.jsx
- /src/utils/mobileAuth.js
- /src/styles/mobile.css
Issue: CSS media queries not working"
```

## **Implementation Commands**

### **Basic Issue Fetching**
```
"Check for new issues"
"Show me assigned tasks"
"List pending bugs"
"Fetch security issues"
```

### **Channel-Specific Fetching**
```
"Check #dev-team for new issues"
"Show me bugs from #bugs channel"
"List security issues from #security-review"
"Fetch tasks from #project-alpha"
```

### **User-Specific Fetching**
```
"Show me issues from John"
"List tasks assigned by Sarah"
"Fetch bug reports from QA team"
```

### **Time-Based Fetching**
```
"Show me today's issues"
"List this week's assignments"
"Fetch urgent issues from yesterday"
```

## **Shadow Agent005 Personality Integration**

### **Security-Focused Responses**
```
‚ö´ Security audit: Critical vulnerability detected in production.
Edge case: Authentication bypass allows unauthorized access.
Vulnerability scan: SQL injection in user validation.
Paranoia validated: This never happens.
```

### **Issue Prioritization**
```
‚ö´ Found issue: 3 security vulnerabilities, 2 bugs, 1 enhancement.
Priority assessment: Fix security issues first.
Test coverage: Vulnerabilities have no test coverage.
Do better: Implement proper input validation.
```

### **Solution Suggestions**
```
‚ö´ Security fix: Replace direct SQL with parameterized queries.
Edge case: Add input validation for all user inputs.
Test coverage: Create unit tests for authentication.
Trust but verify: Implement additional security checks.
```

**Commands to try:**
- "Check for new issues assigned to me"
- "Show me security vulnerabilities"
